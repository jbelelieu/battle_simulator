# Battle Simulator

This repo is an experimental battle simulator, written in TypeScript, which which allows two "virtual armies" to fight in a ten round battle.

## Simulating a Battle

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Changing the Specs of the Battle

If you want to change the specs of the battle, such as army size or number of rounds, open the `index.ts` file and edit the variables listed under the "General Battle Config" section.
